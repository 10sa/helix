Helix is a *work-in-progress* framework for roleplay gamemodes in [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/), based off of [NutScript 1.1](https://github.com/rebel1324/NutScript). Helix provides a stable, feature-filled, open-source, and DRM-free base so you can focus more on the things you want: making gameplay.

Since Helix is still in active development, we'd advise you not to use it for any of your projects just yet - many things can and will change until we tweak and polish things off enough for an eventual release.

## Contributing
Feel free to submit a pull request with any fixes/changes that you might find beneficial. Currently, there are no solid contributing guidelines other than keeping your code consistent with the rest of the framework.

## Acknowledgements
Helix is a fork of NutScript 1.1 by [Chessnut](https://github.com/brianhang) and [rebel1234](https://github.com/rebel1324). Much of the documentation and support can still be applied here, so check out the NutScript community if you're looking to get involved.
